A simple web app to highlight the dearth of information on Wikipedia about important women in technology.

Users are presented with an individual's name and recent tweets mentioning her name. Depending on the individual's presence on Wikipedia, users are prompted to create a new page or to update an existing page. The site suggests a different individual to create/edit upon each refresh.

Database seeded using data from a public spreadsheet maintained by the Anita Borg Institute and the Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgtB-ve2c_3ydDFiVkt3U3FTUXJBb0VydmRHc3FVS3c&usp=drivesdk), Wikipedia, and http://stats.grok.se/.

Inspired by Art+Feminism (art.plusfeminism.org) and the CRA-W and Anita Borg Institute Wikipedia Project (http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/wikipedia/index.html).

Updates in progress:
- Changes to CSS templates and other minor fixes.
- Adding a feature to allow users to update the database if they create a new page for an individual.
- Adding a feature to present a full index of the site and to allow searching by individual.
